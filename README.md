# MultiPath Band Structure Calculator (MPBCalc)

The MPBCalC tool streamlines semiconductor band structure analysis, generating necessary simulation files for exploring critical Brillouin points using the NEMO3D atomistic tight-binding software. The tool provides post-processing capabilities, including effective mass calculations, bandstructure characteristics identifications and bandstructure visualization.
